Introduction
-------------------

S/w testing is the process of finding defects in a software.

Manual Testing
-------------------
Performing the testing without using any tools is known as manual tesing.
Here, a tester will do the testing as would a real-time end user.

Problems faced during manual testing and need for automation testing:

1) Re-Testing - same set of testing done multiple times. eg. Login testing using multiple dataset

2) Regression Testing - 

        Regression testing is a type of software testing that ensures that recent code changes haven't adversely affected existing features. The primary goal is to confirm that the software still functions as expected after modifications, such as bug fixes, enhancements, or new features.

        ### Key Aspects of Regression Testing:

        1. **Scope**: It involves retesting existing functionalities and verifying that the system behaves as intended after changes.

        2. **Types**:
        - **Full Regression Testing**: Tests all features to ensure overall functionality.
        - **Partial Regression Testing**: Focuses on specific areas impacted by the changes.
        - **Unit Regression Testing**: Involves testing individual components or units of the software.

        3. **Automation**: Often automated due to the repetitive nature of the tests, which saves time and increases efficiency.

        4. **When to Perform**: Commonly conducted after bug fixes, during the integration of new features, and prior to releases.

        5. **Tools**: Various testing tools can aid in regression testing, such as Selenium, TestComplete, and QTP.

        ### Importance:
        - **Quality Assurance**: Helps maintain software quality and reliability.
        - **Risk Mitigation**: Identifies potential issues early in the development cycle.
        - **Cost-Effectiveness**: Detecting issues sooner can reduce the cost of fixing them later.

        Overall, regression testing is a critical part of the software development lifecycle, ensuring that changes enhance the product without introducing new problems.

The challenges of Re-testing and Regression testing is that both type of tesing take lot of efforts from the tester side and it is very time consuming as well.

Hence, to overcome these challenges, we need autoamtion tools for testing

Automation Testing

    Performing software testing on test cases using certain available tools is known as automation testing.

What is Test-case in software testing?

    A test case in software testing is a specific set of conditions or variables under which a tester assesses whether a software application behaves as expected. It includes detailed steps to execute the test, the expected results, and any necessary prerequisites.

    ### Key Components of a Test Case:

    1. **Test Case ID**: A unique identifier for the test case.
    
    2. **Test Description**: A brief summary of what the test case will validate.

    3. **Preconditions**: Any setup or conditions that must be met before executing the test.

    4. **Test Steps**: Detailed instructions on how to execute the test, usually in a sequential order.

    5. **Test Data**: Any input data needed to perform the test.

    6. **Expected Results**: The anticipated outcome of the test, based on the requirements.

    7. **Actual Results**: The outcome observed when the test is executed.

    8. **Status**: Indicates whether the test passed or failed.

    9. **Postconditions**: The state of the system after executing the test, if relevant.

    ### Purpose of Test Cases:

    - **Verification**: Ensure the software behaves as intended.
    - **Documentation**: Provide a clear record of testing efforts.
    - **Reusability**: Can be reused in future testing cycles.
    - **Communication**: Serve as a common understanding between testers, developers, and stakeholders.

    Overall, well-defined test cases are essential for effective testing, helping ensure software quality and reliability.

Manual test-case vs automation test-case

    Test cases play a crucial role in both manual and automated testing, but their application and approach differ between the two methods. Hereâ€™s a comparison of test cases in manual testing versus automation testing:

    ### Manual Testing

    1. **Execution**:
    - Test cases are executed manually by testers who follow the steps outlined in the test case.
    - Testers can use their judgment to explore unexpected scenarios or bugs.

    2. **Flexibility**:
    - Testers can adapt on the fly, exploring edge cases or variations not covered in the original test case.

    3. **Complexity**:
    - Manual testing is better suited for complex scenarios requiring human observation, such as usability testing.

    4. **Documentation**:
    - Test cases need to be clearly documented to guide manual testers.
    - Testers may log results and observations directly.

    5. **Time and Resources**:
    - Manual testing can be time-consuming and may require more resources for repetitive tests.

    6. **Maintenance**:
    - Changes in the application may require frequent updates to test cases, making them harder to maintain.

    ### Automation Testing

    1. **Execution**:
    - Test cases are written in a programming or scripting language and are called "Test-Scripts" and executed by automation tools.
    - Tests run without human intervention, allowing for faster execution.

    2. **Reusability**:
    - Automated test cases can be reused across different versions of the application, making them cost-effective over time.

    3. **Consistency**:
    - Automation eliminates human error, providing consistent results across test runs.

    4. **Speed**:
    - Automated tests can run much faster than manual tests, especially useful for regression testing and repetitive tasks.

    5. **Maintenance**:
    - Test cases must be maintained and updated in the automation framework, which can be resource-intensive if changes are frequent.

    6. **Initial Setup**:
    - Requires an initial investment in time and resources to create the test scripts and set up the automation environment.

    ### Summary

    - **Manual Testing** is ideal for exploratory, usability, and ad-hoc testing where human intuition is valuable. It's flexible but time-consuming.
    - **Automation Testing** is best for repetitive, regression, and performance tests, offering speed and consistency but requiring upfront effort for setup and maintenance.

    In practice, many teams adopt a hybrid approach, using both manual and automated testing to leverage the strengths of each method.
